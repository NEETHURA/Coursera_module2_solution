                    Chandrayaan-1 was India's first lunar probe. It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation on 22 October 2008, and was operated until August 2009. The mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor. The mission was a major boost to India's space program, as India researched and developed its own technology in order to explore the Moon. The vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.

                    Chandrayaan-2 was launched from the second launch pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 22 July 2019 at 2.43 PM IST (09:13 UTC) to the Moon by a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III). The planned orbit has a perigee of 169.7 km and an apogee of 45475 km. It consists of a lunar orbiter, lander and rover, all developed in India. The main scientific objective is to map the location and abundance of lunar water.

                    Aditya-L1 is the first Indian observatory class mission to study the solar corona using a solar coronagraph and also chromosphere using near UV instrument.
                    X-ray spectroscopic instruments will provide flare spectra while the in-situ payload observes the solar events during their passage from Sun to Earth.
                    This mission will take around 109 Earth days after launch to reach the halo orbit around the L1 point, which is about 1,500,000 km from Earth.
